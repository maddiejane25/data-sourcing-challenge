Module 6 challenge

# Overview
In this challenge, API information from NASA weather was used to calculate time that it takes for CME to cause a GST. 

# Observation
The data in this merged data frame is representative of data retrieved from an API key in Chicago. We observed that there was variation in the GST calculations between Joe's dataset and my and my peer's datasets.
